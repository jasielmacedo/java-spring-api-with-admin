## About this project

I've created an API Rest in Java using Spring with admin area.

For this API, I'm using JWT for authentication integrated with native security framework from Spring.

And for admin i'm using Basic authentication using native security framework from spring too.

basically the api runs inside /api/ url and admin inside /admin/ url

Check [SecurityConfig.java](https://github.com/jasielmacedo/java-spring-api-with-admin/blob/main/src/main/java/com/apiadmincore/core/config/SecurityConfig.java) for more info


That's it for now, im the future i'll try to explain the entire code.
